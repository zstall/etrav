# etrav Git
In this repository is an attempt at a html email. This was a culminating html email project that I completed from codeschool.com. All of the assets were provided by codeschool.com and I added my own touches and style in the final email.

## Image much? Preview below:
The full html email has animated backgrounds and buttons.

## To view the email:
Clone, download, or branch the etrav repository. Find index.html in the src file and launch in your favorite web-browser. (Note: the fading animation for the background images is not supported in IE)
Also, this email is responsive and will look great on PC, tablet, or phone.

## Like what you see?
I have other project here on gitHub, and I am always trying to learn more coding skills. 
If you looking for a junior dev, or need someone who is ready to work hard, collaborate, and learn I'm your person.

I currently work in HTML, Java, Python, CSS, git, and more!
